# touchdesigner-playground

A collection of TouchDesigner sketches.

## [ball-grid](./ball-grid)

Using the Line SOP and Spring SOP to create a grid of instanced geometry that behaves a bit like a fabric.

## [black-hole](./black-hole)

The Circle SOP, Noise SOP and a feedback loop to create an old school Doctor Who intro type of look.

## [cloud-walker](./cloud-walker)

Using noise to drive the height map of a phong material. The effect can look like clouds or landscape.

## [cube-of-cubes](./cube-of-cubes)

Yep. It's a cube made up of smaller cubes. Use some noise to drive the scale and color of the cubes.

## [cube-party](./cube-party)

Arranging boxes in a sphere orientation. Using noise to drive the color and scale of the boxes.

## [fire-ball](./fire-ball)

Spheres in a particle system blended together to look a bit like a fire and smoke explosion.

## [fishy](./fishy)

Instancing circles along a circle and scaling the instances down as they go. The effect is like looking at a fish from above.

## [flame-fish](./flame-fish)

Very similar to "fishy" with some added noise to create a different effect.

## [geometry-ring](./geometry-ring)

Instancing boxes around a circle and using some LFOs to animate their scale and orientation.

## [gradient-circles](./gradient-circles)

Trying to achieve a 2D gradient look using Circle TOPs and feedback.

## [json-from-api](./json-from-api)

An example of working with JSON from a REST API endpoint.

## [kaleidoscope](./kaleidoscope)

Using Mirror TOPs to create a kaleidoscope affect.

## [neon-splatter](./neon-splatter)

Loading and playing an image sequence to create a neon splatter.

## [nested-noise-balls](./nested-noise-balls)

Using noise to make instanced geometry appear to melt and re-grow.

## [particle-blob](./particle-blob)

A particle system animated around a circle to look like a smoke trail.

## [pour-painting](./pour-painting)

Using noise and cache-selecting to imitate the look of an acrylic pour painting.

## [sea-waves](./sea-waves)

Sending noise through instanced geometry to give the impression of ocean waves.

## [spiky-ouroboros](./spiky-ouroboros)

Instanced geometry around a circle. Using noise to make it look like a weird metal snake.

## [threshold-to-geo](./threshold-to-geo)

A simple example of using a thresholded image to drive instanced geometry.

## [timer-switch](./timer-switch)

A really simple example of driving a switch with time.
